# Silvana's SQL Portfolio 
Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! 
This repository contains a series of projects that highlight examples of SQL I have written and my data base management skills. Here, you will find a collection of diverse SQL queries, data models, and analytics reports. 
Each project includes detailed documentation and annotations to explain the thought process and methodologies applied. I invite you to explore my work and see how I transform data into meaningful solutions.
